2. **Unified branding:** Consistent Go Tawee identity across both services  
3. **Mobile-first:** Ensure all new features work seamlessly on mobile
4. **Performance:** No degradation to existing food delivery features

### Technical Decisions
- **Service Toggle:** Top-level switcher rather than separate apps
- **Navigation:** Add 5th tab instead of replacing existing structure
- **State Management:** Browser localStorage for service preference
- **Simulation Approach:** Use setTimeout for real-time updates during development
- **Map Integration:** Placeholder implementation ready for Google Maps/Mapbox

### Architecture Notes
- All ride pages follow consistent component structure
- CSS variables used for theme consistency
- JavaScript classes for clean state management
- LocalStorage for data persistence between pages
- SVG icons for scalability and performance

### Future Considerations
- Potential for food+ride combo offers
- Driver-restaurant pickup optimization
- Multi-service loyalty program
- Business dashboard for restaurants and drivers
